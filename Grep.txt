Grep Tutorial

1. To find the occurence of a text inside a file:
    grep "hell" hello.txt (will match hell, hello)

2. To find the complete occurence of a word in a file:
    grep -w "hell" hello.txt (will match hell only)

3. To find the complete word and without case insensitive:
    grep -wi "hell" hello.txt (will match hell, Hell, HeLL etc)

4. To find the line number of the word:
    grep -n "hell" hello.txt (will match and give the line number)

5. To see the given number of lines before a match:
    grep -w -B NO_OF_LINES_BEFORE_MATCH "hello" hello.txt

6. To see the given number of lines after a match:
    grep -w -A NO_OF_LINES_AFTER_MATCH "hello" hello.txt

7. To see the same number of lines before and after match:
    grep -C NO_OF_LINES "hello" hello.txt

8. To see the matches in a number of files in a present directory:
    grep -wi  "hello" ./* (will try to match words in a subdirectory too)

9. To see the matches in a number of files of a given type in
    present directory:
    grep -wi "hello" ./*txt (will try to match words present in txt files
        in the present directory)

10. To see the matches in the subdirectories using the recursive search:
    grep -wir "hello" ./

11. To show the files that match and not the word that matched in subdirectories:
    grep -wirl "hello" ./

12. To show the count of matches in a given file, remove l while using:
    grep -c "hello" hello.txt (it also list files with zero matches)

13. To search for a word in a specific type of files in directory or within
    subdirectories:
    grep -r --include=/*extension_name "hello" ./
