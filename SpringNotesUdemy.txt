Why Spring?

    -   Early version of EJB(v1 and v2) were extremely complex !!!
    -   Multiple deployment descriptors.
    -   Multiple Interfaces.
    -   Poor Performance of Entity Beans.

What's New in Spring 5?
    -   Updated minimum java requirements for Java 8 or higher
    -   Deprecated Legacy integration for: Tiles, Velocity, Guava etc
    -   Updated Spring MVC to use new versions of Servlet API 4.0
    -   Added new reactive programming framework: Spring WebFlux.

Goals of Spring
    -   LightWeight development with Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)
    -   Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
    -   Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming(AOP)
    -   Minimize boilerplate Java code

Spring Core Container
    -   It manages how beans are created
    -   It has four parts:
            1.  Beans   -   (BeanFactory)It is responsbile for creating beans. Read Config files, setting properties etc
            2.  Core    -   creating beans and making those beans available
            3.  SpEl    -   Spring Expression Language, used within the config file to refer to other beans
            4.  Context -   It is responsible to hold the beans in the memory

Spring Infrastructure
    -   Aop             -   It allows to create applciation wide services like logging, security, transaction, instrumentation.
                            No need to modify your code, just add a config or annotation.
    -   Aspects         -
    -   Instrumentation -   Creating Java agents to remotely monitor your app with JMX (Java Management Extension)
    -   Messaging       -

Data Access Layer
    -   JDBC            -   JDBC helper classes, helps to reduce the JDBC code by 50 %
    -   ORM             -   Object to Relational Mapping, Integration with hibernate and JPA
    -   Transactions    -   Supporting Transactions on methods, database calls.
    -   OXM             -
    -   JMS             -   Java Message Service, used to send message to the message queue asynchronously

Home for Spring MVC framework(Web Layer)
    -   Servlet         -
    -   WebSocket       -
    -   Web             -
    -   Portlet         -

Test Layer
    -   Unit        -
    -   Integration -
    -   Mock        -

What are Spring "Projects" ?
    -   Additional Spring modules built-on top of the core Spring Framework
    -   Only use what you need,
    -   Spring Cloud, Spring Data
    -   Spring Batch, Spring Security
    -   Spring for Android, Spring Web Flow
    -   Spring Web Services, Spring LDAP

Installing tomcat in linux:
    go to tomcat.apache.org and download the latest tar.gz format file
    sudo -s
    cd /usr/local
    mv apache-tomcat-9.0xxx tomcat9
    vim ~/.bashrc
    write these three lines and save
    export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/tomcat9"
    alias tomcatstart="/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh"
    alias tomcatstop="/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh"
    source ~/.bashrc

To start and stop:
sudo -s
tomcatstart (to start the server)
tomcatstop  (to stop the server)
