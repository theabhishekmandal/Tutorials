Why Spring?

    -   Early version of EJB(v1 and v2) were extremely complex !!!
    -   Multiple deployment descriptors.
    -   Multiple Interfaces.
    -   Poor Performance of Entity Beans.

What's New in Spring 5?
    -   Updated minimum java requirements for Java 8 or higher
    -   Deprecated Legacy integration for: Tiles, Velocity, Guava etc
    -   Updated Spring MVC to use new versions of Servlet API 4.0
    -   Added new reactive programming framework: Spring WebFlux.

Goals of Spring
    -   LightWeight development with Java POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects)
    -   Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
    -   Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming(AOP)
    -   Minimize boilerplate Java code

Spring Core Container
    -   It manages how beans are created
    -   It has four parts:
            1.  Beans   -   (BeanFactory)It is responsbile for creating beans. Read Config files, setting properties etc
            2.  Core    -   creating beans and making those beans available
            3.  SpEl    -   Spring Expression Language, used within the config file to refer to other beans
            4.  Context -   It is responsible to hold the beans in the memory

Spring Infrastructure
    -   Aop             -   It allows to create applciation wide services like logging, security, transaction, instrumentation.
                            No need to modify your code, just add a config or annotation.
    -   Aspects         -
    -   Instrumentation -   Creating Java agents to remotely monitor your app with JMX (Java Management Extension)
    -   Messaging       -

Data Access Layer
    -   JDBC            -   JDBC helper classes, helps to reduce the JDBC code by 50 %
    -   ORM             -   Object to Relational Mapping, Integration with hibernate and JPA
    -   Transactions    -   Supporting Transactions on methods, database calls.
    -   OXM             -
    -   JMS             -   Java Message Service, used to send message to the message queue asynchronously

Home for Spring MVC framework(Web Layer)
    -   Servlet         -
    -   WebSocket       -
    -   Web             -
    -   Portlet         -

Test Layer
    -   Unit        -
    -   Integration -
    -   Mock        -

What are Spring "Projects" ?
    -   Additional Spring modules built-on top of the core Spring Framework
    -   Only use what you need,
    -   Spring Cloud, Spring Data
    -   Spring Batch, Spring Security
    -   Spring for Android, Spring Web Flow
    -   Spring Web Services, Spring LDAP

Installing tomcat in linux:
    go to tomcat.apache.org and download the latest tar.gz format file
    sudo -s
    cd /usr/local
    mv apache-tomcat-9.0xxx tomcat9
    vim ~/.bashrc
    write these three lines and save
    export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/tomcat9"
    alias tomcatstart="/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh"
    alias tomcatstop="/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/shutdown.sh"
    source ~/.bashrc
    sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/tomcat9  => give permission to user

To start and stop:
sudo -s
tomcatstart (to start the server)
tomcatstop  (to stop the server)

Integrating tomcat9 to eclipse:
    -   Open eclipse and go to servers
    -   Select Apache and go to Apache version 9
    -   select the directory as /usr/local/tomcat9

Installing Spring jar files
    -   go to www.luv2code.com/downloadspring
    -   go to latest spring version and download dist.zip file
    -   extract the zip file
    -   goto the lib folder and copy all the jar files
    -   create a java project such as "spring-demo-one"
    -   create a folder named as "lib" and paste all the jar files
    -   now right click on project "spring-demo-one" and goto properties
    -   goto java Build Path -> libraries and then click add jars
    -   Select all the jars and click add and then apply and close

Inversion of Control
    -   Outsource to an object factory
    -   The process of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.
    -   Spring Container Primary Functions
        -   Create and manage objects(Inversion of Control)
        -   Inject object's dependencies(Dependency injection)
    -   Configuring Spring Container
        -   XML Configuration(legacy, but most legacy app still use this)
        -   Java Annotations(modern)
        -   Java Source Code(modern)
    -   Spring Development Process
        -   Configuring your Spring Beans
            -   Using applicationContext.xml file to add the beans
        -   Create a spring Container
            -   Spring Container is generally known as ApplicationContext
                -   Specialized implementations
                    -   ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
                    -   AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
                    -   GenericWebApplicationContext
                    -   others
        -   Retrieve beans from Spring Container
            -   Using ClassPathXmlApplicationContext to create a spring container
            -   retrieving bean from the spring container

What is Spring Bean
    -   A "Spring Bean" is simply a Java Object.
    -   When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then
        Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".
    -   Spring beans are created from normal Java classes just like java objects

What is dependency injection
    -   Dependency injection is a pattern through which we implement IoC,
        where the control being inverted is setting of object's dependencies.
    -   Dependecy injection is the outsourcing and injection of the objects.
    -   Rather than manually creating the objects and it's dependencies
        Spring Framework will do this for us.
    -   Injection Types in Spring that are most commonly used.
        -   Constructor Types
        -   Setter Injection
    -   Injection of literal values can also be done
    -   Injection using properties file,

Bean Scopes
    -   What is Singleton ?
        -   Spring Container only creates only one instance by default
        -   It is cached in memory
        -   All requests to the bean will return the SHARED reference
            to the SAME bean
        -   You can explicitly specify bean scope using the scope keyword in the xml
        -   Scope           Description
            singleton       Create single shared instance of the bean. Default scope.
            prototype       Creates a new bean instance for each container request.
            request         Scoped to an HTTP web request. Only used for web apps.
            session         Scoped to an HTTP web session. Only used for web apps.
            global-session  Scoped to a global HTTP web session. Only used for web apps.

Bean LifeCycle
        -   Container Started ->
                Bean Instantiated ->
                    Dependencies Injected ->
                        Internal Spring Processing ->
                            Your Custom init method ->
                                Bean is Ready to Use/ Container is Shutdown ->
                                    Your Custom Destroy method ->
                                        STOP
        -   You can add custom code during bean initialisation
            -   Calling custom business logic method.
            -  Setting up handles to resources.
        -   You can add custom code during bean destruction.
            -   Calling custom business logic method.
            -   Setting up handles to resources.
        -   Defining init and destroy methods
            -   Access Modifier
                -   The method can have any access modifier(private, public or protected).
            -   Return Type
                -   The method can have any return type. However, void is the most commonly used.
                    If you give the return type just note that you won't be able to capture the
                    return value.
            -   Method name
                -   The method can have any method name.
            -   Arguments
                -   The method cannot accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.
        -   Special Note about Destroy LifeCycle and Prototype Scope
            -   For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method
            -   In contrast to other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecyle
                of a prototype bean
                -   the container instantiates, configures and otherwise assembles a prototype object
                    then it hands this to the client, with no further record of the prototype instance
                -   In the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called.
                    (The client code must cleanup prototype-scoped objects and release expensive
                     resources that the prototype beans are holding).
